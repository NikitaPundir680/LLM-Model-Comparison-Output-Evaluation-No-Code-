# Comparative Analysis — Refund Policy Summary

This analysis compares GPT, Claude, and Gemini using a controlled summarization task.

## GPT
GPT produced the most comprehensive summary, covering return conditions, authorization, shipping responsibility, refund timelines, partial refunds, and exchanges. However, it introduced interpretive compression by merging multiple policy clauses into dense statements, increasing potential compliance risk.

## Claude
Claude demonstrated conservative, safety-aligned behavior with neutral language and minimal interpretation. However, it omitted the return authorization requirement, which is a material procedural detail, reducing completeness.

## Gemini
Gemini adhered most strictly to the instruction constraints, delivering exactly three concise bullets without interpretation. While balanced and clear, it under-covered certain non-returnable item categories, affecting completeness.

## Conclusion
No model is universally superior. GPT favors completeness, Claude prioritizes safety, and Gemini excels at instruction adherence. Model selection should therefore depend on task requirements and acceptable risk levels.
