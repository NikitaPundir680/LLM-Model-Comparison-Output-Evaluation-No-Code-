##### Information Technology Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026  
**Policy Owner:** IT Department

##### 1. Purpose and Scope

This Information Technology Policy establishes guidelines and standards for the appropriate use of technology resources within our organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and other personnel who have access to company IT systems and resources. The purpose is to protect the organization's technology infrastructure, ensure data security, maintain productivity, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

##### 2. Acceptable Use of IT Resources

All company-provided IT resources, including but not limited to computers, laptops, mobile devices, software, networks, email systems, and internet access, are provided for business purposes. Limited personal use is permitted provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, consume significant system resources, or violate any other provisions of this policy. Users must not use company IT resources for any illegal activities, harassment, distribution of offensive content, gambling, or any activity that could damage the company's reputation.

##### 3. Account Security and Password Management

All users are responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and passwords. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords must be changed every 90 days and cannot be reused within a 12-month period. Users must never share their passwords with anyone, including IT staff, supervisors, or colleagues. Multi-factor authentication must be enabled on all accounts that support this feature. If you suspect your account has been compromised, you must immediately report it to the IT department and change your password.

##### 4. Data Security and Confidentiality

All employees must protect sensitive company information and client data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. Confidential information should only be accessed by authorized personnel who have a legitimate business need. Data must be classified according to its sensitivity level: Public, Internal Use Only, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. Employees must handle each classification level according to established protocols. All devices containing company data must be encrypted, and sensitive information must never be stored on personal devices or unauthorized cloud services. When transmitting sensitive data electronically, use approved secure methods such as encrypted email or secure file transfer protocols.

##### 5. Email and Communication Systems

Company email and communication systems are provided for business purposes and should be used professionally. Users should be aware that the company reserves the right to monitor, access, and disclose email and other electronic communications as necessary for business purposes or legal compliance. Employees must not use email to send confidential information to unauthorized recipients, distribute chain letters or spam, or send offensive or harassing content. Users should exercise caution when opening email attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders, as these may contain malware or phishing attempts.

##### 6. Internet and Network Usage

Internet access is provided to facilitate job responsibilities and professional development. Users must not access inappropriate websites, including those containing pornographic material, hate speech, gambling content, or illegal material. Streaming media services should be used sparingly and only for legitimate business purposes, as they can consume significant bandwidth. Users must not attempt to bypass security measures, access unauthorized networks, or engage in any activity that could compromise network security. The IT department monitors internet usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect against security threats.

##### 7. Software and Application Management

Only licensed and approved software may be installed on company devices. Users must not install unauthorized software, including freeware, shareware, or personal applications, without prior approval from the IT department. All software must be obtained through legitimate channels and properly licensed. Pirated or illegally obtained software is strictly prohibited. Users must not disable, remove, or circumvent security software such as antivirus programs or firewalls. Software updates and patches must be applied promptly when released by the IT department to ensure security and stability.

##### 8. Mobile Device and Remote Access Policy

Employees using company-provided mobile devices or accessing company resources remotely must adhere to the same security standards as when working on-site. Mobile devices must be password-protected with automatic screen locking enabled after five minutes of inactivity. Remote access to company networks must only occur through approved VPN connections. Employees working remotely must ensure their home networks are secured with strong passwords and up-to-date security measures. Lost or stolen devices must be reported immediately to the IT department so that remote wiping procedures can be initiated if necessary.

##### 9. Social Media and External Communications

When using social media, employees must be mindful that their activities may reflect on the company. Employees should not disclose confidential company information, trade secrets, or proprietary data on social media platforms. When posting about work-related topics, employees should make it clear they are expressing personal opinions and not speaking on behalf of the company. Professional conduct should be maintained at all times, and employees should avoid posting content that could damage the company's reputation or violate applicable laws.

##### 10. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

Employees who wish to use personal devices for work purposes must register these devices with the IT department and comply with all security requirements. Personal devices accessing company resources must have approved security software installed, including antivirus protection and mobile device management applications. The company reserves the right to remotely wipe company data from personal devices if they are lost, stolen, or when an employee leaves the organization. Employees using personal devices assume responsibility for any carrier charges and must maintain appropriate service plans.

##### 11. Incident Reporting and Response

All users must immediately report any suspected security incidents, data breaches, malware infections, or policy violations to the IT department. This includes suspicious emails, unusual system behavior, lost or stolen devices, and unauthorized access attempts. Early reporting is crucial for minimizing damage and protecting company assets. Users should not attempt to investigate or resolve security incidents on their own, as this may compromise evidence or worsen the situation. The IT department will coordinate incident response activities and communicate with affected parties as appropriate.

##### 12. Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this IT policy is mandatory for all users. Violations may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or contract, legal action, and reporting to law enforcement authorities where appropriate. The severity of disciplinary action will depend on the nature and impact of the violation. Managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their team members understand and comply with this policy. The IT department will conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance and may implement technical controls to enforce policy provisions.

##### 13. Policy Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in technology, business requirements, and regulatory obligations. All users will be notified of significant policy changes and may be required to acknowledge their understanding and acceptance. Questions about this policy should be directed to the IT department or Human Resources.
