#### Refund and Returns Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

Thank you for shopping with us. We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you are not entirely happy with your order, we're here to help. Please read our refund and returns policy carefully to understand your rights and obligations.

##### General Return Policy

We accept returns within 30 days of the original purchase date. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging. The item must also include the receipt or proof of purchase. Please note that certain types of items cannot be returned, which are detailed in the exclusions section below.

##### How to Initiate a Return

To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at support@example.com or call us at 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Please provide your order number, the item you wish to return, and the reason for the return. Our team will provide you with a return authorization number and detailed instructions on how to send your item back to us. Items returned without prior authorization may not be accepted.

##### Return Shipping

Customers are responsible for paying their own shipping costs for returning items unless the return is due to our error, such as receiving an incorrect or defective product. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping may be deducted from your refund where applicable. We recommend using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item.

##### Refund Processing

Once we receive your returned item, our team will inspect it and notify you via email about the status of your refund. If your return is approved, we will process your refund to your original method of payment within 7-10 business days. Please note that depending on your financial institution, it may take an additional 5-10 business days for the refund to appear in your account. If more than 15 business days have passed since we approved your return and you have not received your refund, please contact us immediately.

##### Partial Refunds

In certain situations, only partial refunds may be granted. This includes items that show obvious signs of use, items that are not in their original condition or are damaged through mishandling, and items that are returned more than 30 days after delivery. We reserve the right to deny returns that do not meet our return criteria.

##### Non-Returnable Items

Several types of products are exempt from our return policy. These include perishable goods such as food and flowers, intimate or sanitary products, hazardous materials, and flammable liquids or gases. We also cannot accept returns on downloadable software products, gift cards, and certain health and personal care items. Custom or personalized orders cannot be returned unless they arrive damaged or defective.

##### Exchanges

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged upon arrival. If you need to exchange a product for the same item, please contact our customer service team. Exchanges are subject to product availability.

##### Contact Information

If you have any questions about our refund and returns policy, please don't hesitate to contact us at support@example.com or call 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Our customer service team is available Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM EST.

We reserve the right to modify this returns policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website. Your continued use of our services following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
